# Lesson 1

The answer to the discussion question posed by the professor on the first day of class

## Question: What goes into the implementation of a programming language?

1. A compiler must check the types of variables and whether they are compatible, report back if they are incompatible
2. A compiler must know the target architecture and hardware and know what kind of optimizations it can take advantage of
3. A compiler should check for memoty safety at compile-time, similar to Rust. Memory safety is very important and should be added to a lot of compilers
